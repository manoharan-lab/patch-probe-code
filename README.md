`matlab_feature_extraction` contains Matlab code to extracting integrated
fluorescence intensities from a raw microarray image.

`microarray_design` contains Matlab code to generate probe sequences and layouts
for DNA microarrays.

`patchprobe` is a python package for analysis of patch-probe microarray data.
See the file `environment.yml` for instructions on how to set up the conda
environment for running the code. See `example-analysis-notebook.ipynb` for a
demonstration of how to use the package.
